# Forerent
## AI-Powered Rental Property Management System

**Forerent** is an AI-powered rental property management system designed to assist property owners, managers, and tenants by providing intelligent rental price suggestions, maintenance cost forecasting, and revenue trend predictions. The system integrates **Multiple Regression** and **Hierarchical Clustering** techniques to support data-driven decision-making in rental property operations.

## Specific Objectives

The study aims to:

- Examine and understand the process of developing an AI-powered rental property management system.
- Explore existing systems and applications related to rental property management and predictive analytics.
- Analyze, preprocess, and prepare datasets for training predictive models.
- Train, evaluate, and compare predictive models for:
  - Rental price suggestions
  - Maintenance cost forecasting
  - Revenue trend prediction
- Compare **Multiple Regression with Hierarchical Clustering** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with Hierarchical Clustering** using the following evaluation metrics:

### Evaluation Metrics
